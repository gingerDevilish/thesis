This model (and all the following models) was built with keras, with help of an official keras tutorial (https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html).
The structure was left unchanged from the content of the first part of a tutorial, save for very minor changes. Then a dataset was chosen â€” for training, we took the least recent date from each weather from each parking, resulting in about 11k samples. For validation, we took two most recent dates from each weather from each parking, resulting in about 16k samples. All pictures were resized to 60*40, with some further preparation with standard means (oversampling and randomization with added distortions for robustness).
The model shows accuracy on validation set about 91%, according to keras report on the network learning.
