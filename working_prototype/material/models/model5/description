This model was born since we found out that for one of cameras on the parking which had two cameras we didnâ€™t cut slots for a dataset for some reason. So we found it out and decided to cut it, and got the second folder of our dataset.
Thus, this time, for training set we got 5k alphabetically first images from the first part of our dataset remaining, and 5k first images from the second part, for both empty and occupied slots, totaling 20k samples. For validation, we then took 30k empty spaces and 30k occupied spaces from the first part, and 15k empty spaces and 30k occupied spaces from the second part, totaling 105k images. In practice, this is the best performing model we got so far, so this is the one that is currently used for our prototype. Another reason for that might be that previous models were trained with 1 to 3 epochs, while this one was trained with 5 epochs, even though on the validation set the quality deteriorates after the second epoch.
